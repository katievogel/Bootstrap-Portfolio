                    Hello! My name is Katie Vogel, and I am an aspiring programmer. I have my Bachelor of Science in Animal Science from the Pennsylvania State University. Since graduation, I have worked in the pharmaceutical industry ranging from research, electronic database development, patient reported outcomes, and clinical payments. As a project manager I have lead the development of technology tools used to record data in clinical trials. So, what does this have to do with web development?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Absolutely nothing and everything! One day I realized that my creativity was simply too strong to be caged by the restrictive nature of the industry I was in. I was bored of sending emails all day, and sitting on calls, and sending tasks to other people.  I just didn't know where my artistic nature could be used. Then a little birdie said to me one day, "Why don't you learn how to code?" So I thought, why not, gave it a shot, and really enjoyed it. Now I've taken that big leap to change my career. This page will be updated as I learn and create more and more. If you have questions or comments about my work, feel free to reach out to me via the contact information provide under the Contact section.
